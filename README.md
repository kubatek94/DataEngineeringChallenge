# DataEngineeringChallenge

To start this challenge you will need docker.

To run all the required infrastructure you will need to navigate to /KafkaDataProducer and run ```docker-compose up -d```. This will spin up zookeeper, kakfa, kafka connect, sql server and a c# app to produce messages onto kafka.
